Abstract

An imitator—or a copycat—often enters a market to compete against an innovator. This article proposes a modeling approach that incorporates imitative entry in which an imitator produces a low-end product that imitates a high-end product produced by the innovator. If no imitator enters the market, the innovator can operate as a monopolist, producing and selling both a high- and a low-end version of the product to consumers. We find that imitative entry changes the nature of strategic dynamics in various ways and, thus, has counterintuitive implications for strategic decision-making. Specifically, although the imitator’s product is inferior to the monopolist’s low-end product, the quality of the innovator’s high-end product is higher with than without the imitative entry—that is, imitative entry enhances the quality of the high-end product. This is true even when consumers are loyal to the high-end product. We also find that in addition to boosting the quality of the high- end product, imitative entry can boost the quality of the low-end product. In other words, imitative entry helps enhance product quality for the entire market. Perhaps more interestingly, the imitator can even benefit from consumer loyalty to the product of its rival, the innovator.
